# notscreenshots
Simple 90s style website made for ebysslabs with HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT

My husband is a digital artist and creates NFTs, so he wanted me to create a 90s style website that showcases them. People call NFTs screenshots, which they are not, so notscreenshots.com was born. A very busy and flashy website like you were teleported to the 90s!
